Nepbot is an open-source Discord bot for NEP token-based community management, making it easy to set up token-gated channels, manage roles and launch exclusive NFTs for community members. With intuitive commands and ensured security, it enables token-gated experience for Discord communities in the NEAR ecosystem, including the Octopus Network. By connecting one’s own Discord account to a Near wallet, and setting up token-gated Discord roles, community members can verify their identity and assets on Near, therefore gaining access to specific content.

Note that if you want to interact with the NEAR ecosystem by using your wallet or creating a custom address, we advise you to send at least 1 NEAR there. You will be able to do so after account creation. If you don’t have NEAR on any other wallet, you can fund your account by buying NEAR on Moonpay/Utorg or transferring it from any supported exchange. Also, you can bridge tokens from MetaMask, using a Rainbow Bridge: Click “Top Up” in your wallet. Choose any preferable option and follow the instructions of our partner. If you already have NEAR on another wallet, follow these simple steps: Click “Deposit Near” in your NEAR wallet. Copy your Account ID or get a code via scanning the QR code. Go to a Sending wallet from which you want to transfer NEAR. Click “Send” and enter the number of coins you want to transfer. Paste a NEAR address or QR code. Wait for a confirmation message stating that the transaction is completed. As soon as you receive the funds, your account activates automatically.
