1. Choose a role to add a rule to it. There‚Äôre four types of rules for now.
    
    Rule types:
    
    1. **Token amount: gated by NEP-141 tokens.**
        
        You need to fill in the token address and token amount as the threshold. The user can be assigned with the role by holding at least a certain amount of the selected token.

    2. **OCT roles: gated by the staking states(delegator/validator) on Octopus Appchains.**
        
        Choose an appchain and its staking status on that appchain. For example, in the screenshot below, it means that the role is open for delegators on Fusotao appchain.

    3. **Near balance: gated by Near balance.**
        
        Enter the amount of $Near required for this role.

    4. **NFT: gated by an NEP-171 NFT (including those on Paras or from other NFT contracts)**
        
        You‚Äôll need to enter the NFT contract ID and the minimum number of NFT required. NFT contract ID can be found in the details of an NFT. Take Mintbase as an example, you can find the contract ID here.

        ![Untitled](../assets/Set_rules_for_roles/Untitled%207.png)
        
        If the NFT are created on Paras with a contract ID of x.paras.near, you will also need to provide the collection URL here to distinct the collections.

2. Click on ‚Äúok‚Äù to save the rule, approve the transaction and after a while, it will be added to the list and start to take effect.
    
    > *This will start a transaction because the rule is saved on chain, and therefore requires a transaction with the smart contract.*
    >

    It will ask for a 0.02 Near as the estimated maximum amount of gas, but the transaction may cost less than 0.02Near. The rest of the pre-charged fees will be returned to your wallet.

3. Once the rules are set, Nepbot will constantly monitors the verified accounts‚Äô balance and status and manage roles accordingly.
    
    You can also delete a rule by hitting the ‚Äúdelete‚Äù button under each rule.
