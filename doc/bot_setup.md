1. After authorization, go back to your discord server, and you’ll find NepBot there. :)
2. Upon joining the server, NepBot will create a role for itself in the Discord “server settings”. **Make sure “Nepbot” is at the top of the server role hierarchy. It needs to be above any roles it will moderate.**

    In “server settings” go to ”roles”, then hold and drag on the left of each role to manage role hierarchy.
