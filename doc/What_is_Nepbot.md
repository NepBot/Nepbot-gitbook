# What is Nepbot?

Nepbot is an open-source Discord bot for NEP token-based community management, making it easy to set up token-gated channels, manage roles and launch exclusive NFTs for community members.

With intuitive commands and ensured security, it enables token-gated experience for Discord communities in the NEAR ecosystem, including the Octopus Network. 

By connecting oneâ€™s own Discord account to a Near wallet, and setting up token-gated Discord roles, community members can verify their identity and assets on Near, therefore gaining access to specific content.
